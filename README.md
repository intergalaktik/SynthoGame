Synthogame RP2040 base FM synthesis synth

What is FM synthesis?

FM synthesis is short for frequency modulation synthesis.

FM synthesis is a method of generating complex timbres by modulating the frequency of one sound with another.

FM was invented by John Chowning at Stanford University in the late 60s, but it didn’t become popular until Yamaha released the DX7 synthesizer based on the technology in 1983.

The DX7 sold thousands of units and went on to define the sound of synths in the 1980s.

Simply put, FM synthesis uses one signal called, the “modulator” to modulate the pitch of another signal, the “carrier”, that’s in the same or a similar audio range.

This creates brand new frequency information in the resulting sound, changing the timbre without the use of filters.

For clarity’s sake, “timbre” is the distinctive character of a sound. The timbre of a sound depends upon its frequency content.The frequencies present in a piano sound, for example, are different than those in a guitar sound, even at the same pitch and level. This is what makes them sound different.
